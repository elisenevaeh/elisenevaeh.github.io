        <h2 id="lovetriangle">First post: Taylor Swift's "Folklore"</h2>
        <p>Taylor Swift is by far one of the most talented music artists and songwriters of our generation. She has released 8 amazing albums in the last 14 years of her career. Her most recent album "Folklore" involves a love triangle that is explained in about 4 songs. This love triangle involves James, Betty, and another girl who is never named in the album. (Most people call her August because the song about her is called "August".) James and Betty had been in a relationship for a while when James went on a trip with his family for an entire summer. On this vacation, James met August. The two of them began a relationship and August quickly fell in love with James. When James returned, he easily let go of the relationship with August which made it very obvious to her that he had never really loved her and that he was never really hers. In the song "August," she says, "Wanting was enough For me, it was enough To live for the hope of it all Cancel plans just in case you'd call" and she also says "But I can see us Lost in the memory August slipped away into a moment in time 'Cause it was never mine." These lyrics make it very obvious that although she was deeply in love with him and willing to do anything for him, he did not reciprocate those feelings. The reason August is never actually named in the album is because she was never important enough to James for him to acknowledge her with her name. The very next song on the album is called "Illicit Affairs" and it is also written from August's point of view and it is explaining how unsatisfied August was having to be "the other woman" and having to be secretive, so she finally comes to terms with the fact that James is just using her and he really isn't worth her time anymore. In this song, she talks about the realities of illicit affairs by saying things like "What started in beautiful rooms Ends with meeting in parking lots" and "It's born from just one single glance But it dies and it dies and it dies a million little times" to convey that although she loved James, their relationship started to drain her and it couldn't be sustained anymore because it was very one-sided. When James returned, Betty found out through a mutual friend that James had been cheating on her so she broke up with him. Throughout the song "Betty," which is written from James's point of view, James is explaining himself (or giving excuses rather) and asking Betty if she'll forgive him and take him back. The last song that involves this love triangle is "Cardigan." This song was written from Betty's point of view and she is basically reminiscing on her relationship with James and how he made her feel. During the best part of their relationship, she says "And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed You put me on and said I was your favorite" showing that at one point James truly valued her and their relationship. Later in the song she goes on to say "A friend to all is a friend to none Chase two girls, lose the one," implying that because he chased both girls at the same time he lost the one that was really "the one" for him which was Betty.

        <h2 id="tlgad">Second post: "The Last Great American Dynasty"</h2>  
        <p>
"The Last Great American Dynasty" is another song on Taylor Swift's "Folklore" album that has a really interesting underlying story. This song tells the story of a girl named Rebecca who marries a very rich man and essentially ruins his life. Rebecca is a middle class divorcee who was lucky enough to meet a man named Bill who was very wealthy. Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and lots of money. After they were married, they picked out a vacation home in Rhode Island where Rebecca would throw the most elaborate parties. Soon after they were married, Bill passed away from a heart attack and his whole family blamed Rebecca for it because of the amount of energy she took out of him. After Bill died and Rebecca inherited his money, Rebecca brought a lot of her friends to Rhode Island and they blew through her new money living lavishly and spending flippantly. The whole family spoke very little of Rebecca. For example the song says "And they said, 'There goes the last great American dynasty' Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been." They would call her the maddest woman the town had ever seen as well as the loudest woman and the most shameless woman. The song also says, "She had a marvelous time ruining everything," showing how the family completely antagonized her constantly. At the end of the song, Taylor Swift buys the house from Rebecca (true story) and makes many parallels to Rebecca's life and her own. People have always been very critical of Taylor Swift and they have demonized everything she's done for years. In the last few lines of the song, she repeats the chorus but she changes the pronouns from "she" to "I" to show that the way Rebecca had been treated is the way she has always felt that people have treated her.
